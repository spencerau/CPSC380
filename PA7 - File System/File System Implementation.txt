The inode numbers of file1 and file2 are the same when using a hard link; they also have the same contents

file2.txt still exists when 'rm file1.txt' is called

Cannot boot Mac in Recovery mode to disable SIP and cannot install strace on docker container

The system call used for rm in Unix systems is unlink() for a file or unlinkat() for a pathname; in this case since we are already in the directory the system call used would be unlink()

The inode numbers of file3 and file4 are different as it is a soft link

If I edit file4.txt, then the same edit will show in file3.txt

However, if upon deleting file3.txt, and attempting to edit file4.txt, only a blank file is shown
